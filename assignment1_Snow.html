        <p> “404 Page Not Found” by Kate Wagner explores the contrast of how the internet looks and functions from the time she was first introduced to it up to the present. Wanger delves into descriptions of how early website design fell short due to limitations in software. She also explains how directories and webpages were used to easily access sites of similar content. The design of the early internet was extremely barebones. Text was always locked to the left, only simple graphic colors and fonts could be used, and most sites were not incorporating wayfinding and good UI into their sites. </p>

        <p> Wagner then goes on to cite the work of Geert Lovink, who writes about the internet’s history in three distinct periods. The first period was a time before the World Wide Web was commercial and was only used by scientists to create a shared network of findings. The second period opened up the internet to the general audience, such as Kate Wagner. Now people could use the internet to look up basic websites leading to a large influx of web companies in the late 90s. We are in the third period, past the rise and crash of dot com mania. </p>


        <p> As many new visitors came to the internet, they brought with them their data. And Wanger goes on to explain how the internet has become yet another facet of our capitalist culture. Looking at the largest companies today, many have gained their revenue through the internet, some in more malicious ways than others. And when these companies dissolve, they leave a huge trail of user data in their wake. This data can be sold to other advertisers and companies creating more personalized online marketing. Wagner is trying to explain that the internet has amplified aspects of consumer culture feeding our capitalist system. </p>

        <p> Wagner goes on to discuss the differences between the internet before and after the internet. She talks about the level of customizability that websites such as Myspace have. Now, social media is more streamlined and similar. Wagner talks about different connotations young people have with certain social media platforms. Most felt that Facebook was for older people and those with more status. However, Myspace was seen as more low-brow because of its content and design. When Myspace shut down in 2013 they gave little warning and took a lot of user data with them. This is a prime example of the risk run in trusting websites with our information. </p>

        <p> As the web expands it becomes ever more diverse. Wagner points out the myriad of different websites a current user has to choose from. This has expanded beyond social media and forums to include; webcomics, games, video editors, photo editors, etc… But in a world with more and more websites, the competition increases for the viewer's attention. </p>

        <p> It is hard to imagine the internet before my first interaction with it. All of the changes it took to get where it has gotten. By the time I started using the internet, websites were more sleek and Google was the main search engine. This is very different from Wagner's experience. She grew up seeing the internet evolve from its early stages. It’s interesting to think how less of a significant role the internet played in people's lives back in the early 90s. I now use the internet most days as do many of my friends and family. This is in part because of websites and search engines becoming more user-friendly and UI driven. The amount of growth the internet has gone through in the last 30 years is astounding and it is very possible it will change that much more in the next 30.</p>
